      <p>Hi there! I’m Jenny Lai. 👩🏻‍💻<br>
      <p>I’m a full stack web developer who is passionate about learning and discovering new innovations. I’m fond of JavaScript as I enjoy coding/implementing detailed, beautiful front-end experiences. I want to continuously foster my interest in growing as a designer and developer along with building creative products, hopefully in a role at your company. 😉<br>When I’m not coding, I can be typically found petting a dog with a taco in the other hand. I’m always up for a good adventure and would love to travel to the world in my lifetime. 🚀</p><br>
